2x2 Rubik cube solver
	- Chandan Ahire

I learned solving Rubiks cube and got intressted in speed cubing aswell since class 8. Also I was into Arduino since last year so eventually I ended up with an idea of making own rubiks cube solver. Like many people searching for "Rubik's Cube Solver" on Google, one of the first robots I found was the Tilted Twister design by Hans Andersson made with lego which has a simple design which can be implemented easily using basic knowledge of auduino.

Aim :-
As a begineer, I started with a simple algorithm of 2x2 rubik cube. My aim was to successfully solve a rubik cube using a robotic arm. 

Materials Used :-
Electronics:
- Arduino UNO R3
- 2 servos (I used MG995s)
- wires
- USB cable

Hardware:
- popsicle sticks
- wooden skewers
- thin plywood
- wooden wheel (skewer must fit inside the hole)
- hot glue
- paper towel roll

Software:
- Arduino IDE - (Algorithms in C++)

Concept :-
After researching, and discussing with seniors I found out the simplest approach to solve a rubik cube is using mathematical path. God's Number shows the smallest number of moves needed to solve the Rubik's Cube from any random starting position and it is 14 quater turns or 11 half turns for 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube.
Reduction to the graph problem:
We treat every possible combination of our Rubik cube as a node in the graph and an undirected edge exist between 2 nodes if we can reach one node from another node by applying only single operation from the set of 6 operations(quater turns)(F,Fi,L,Li,U,Ui).
So, now our problem is reduced to find the shortest path from the start position (or node) to the final position. Since there are no weights on an edge we can find the shortest path using Breadth First Search(BFS).

Electronics :-
Two servos are used
Push Servo(PIN 6)- This servo is responsible for two machanical moves, one to push rubik cube and one to hold rubik cube when rotate servo rotates it.
Rotate Servo(PIN 9)- This is responsible for rotating cube.

Mechanical Design :-
The mechanism(Idea of Hans Anderson) has basically two parts :- 
i) A platform holds and rotates the cube - This platform is connected with Rotate servo.
ii) The arm pushes and holds the cube - This arm is made using Push servo.
This push and rotation will eventually solve the cube.

Shortest Path Algorithm in C++ :-
The main challenge was the number of possible configurations for our 2x2x2 Rubik cube is 24!. Note that some of the configuration states are not achievable. But still the number of nodes are huge and therefore we cannot define the full graph initially. Instead, we will use the perm_apply method to find the neighboring nodes at the runtime.
Also to reduce the average time of the algo we will use 2 way BFS to find the shortest path otherwise we may end up visiting 24! nodes.
The maximum number of turns required to solve the cube is up to 14 quarter turns only. So, if the algo hadn't found the answer in 14 turns then we can terminate the code which implies that this configuration of Rubik cube cannot be solved otherwise it will return the answer. Since we are using 2 way BFS we will terminate the code at 16th iteration.
Now, this shortest path is stored in txt file which eventually is used by arduino code and mechanically performed by arm and rotater.

Budget :-
Around 1500 ruppees

Possible Changes :-
-Reading intial stage using sensors.
-Coding in more efficient language.

Future Plans :-
-To work on complex algorithms of 3x3x3 Rubiks cube,
-To make solving more fast,
-Using mordern techniques of machine learning and artificial intelligence,
-Using mordern coding language,
-Making it more efficient in every possible way.

Proposed time of completion :-


A word of thanks :-
I would like to thank to our society seniors for guiding me to complete my project in time and providing chill learning experience, society member Aditya Kumar for helping in every stuck situations. A special thanks to Mr.Varan Shukla for helping in cpp algorithm.
